DO NOT USE THIS YET. THE CODE QUALITY IS CURRENTLY CRAP. NEEDS MORE TESTS;
MORE ASSERTIONS; COMMENTS AND A LOT OF SPEEDUPS. PURELY ALPHA QUALITY!

Description:

Polyclip is a simple library for computing operations on polygons, with 
an emphasis on those needed for the author's DRCBotV2. That said, contributions
outside of the original scope are welcome.

Requirements: None [C compiler]

Why another polygon clipper?:

There are lots of great polygon clippers out there, but many of them 
are extremely heavyweight, limited to fixed-point numbers, or licensed
in such a way that I'm reluctant to use them. PolyClip is a lightweight
polygon clipping library written in vanilla C, and licensed under the
modified BSD license, for use in any software - open or closed source,
commercial or free.

I'd appreciate hearing if you use my software, or if you encounter any bugs!
